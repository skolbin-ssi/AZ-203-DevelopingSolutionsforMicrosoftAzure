1.  In the **Container Instance** blade, locate the **Settings** section and select the **Containers** link.

1.  In the **Containers** section, observe the list of **Events**.

1.  Select the **Logs** tab and observe the text logs from the container instance.
> **Note**: You can also optionally view the **Events** and **Logs** from the **managedcompute** container instance.

> **Note**: After the application finished executing, the container was terminated because it had completed its work.  For the manually created container instance, you indicated that you indicated that a successful exit was acceptable, so the container shows a single execution run.  The automatically created instance did not offer you this option, and assumes the container should always be running, so you will see repeated restarts of the container.

#### Review

In this exercise, you used multiple methods to deploy a container image to an Azure container instance. By using the manual method, you were also able to customize the deployment further and execute task-based applications as part of a container run.

### Exercise 5: Clean up subscription

#### Task 1: Open Cloud Shell and list resource groups

1.  At the top of the portal, select the **Cloud Shell** icon to open a new shell instance.

1.  In the **Cloud Shell** command prompt at the bottom of the portal, type in the following command and press Enter to list all resource groups in the subscription:

    ```bash
    az group list
    ```

1.  Type the following command and press Enter to view a list of possible commands to delete a resource group:

    ```bash
    az group delete --help
    ```

#### Task 2: Delete resource groups

1.  Type the following command and press Enter to delete the **ContainerCompute** resource group:

    ```bash
    az group delete --name ContainerCompute --no-wait --yes
    ```

1.  Close the **Cloud Shell** pane at the bottom of the portal.

#### Task 3: Close active applications

1.  Close the currently running **Microsoft Edge** application.

#### Review

In this exercise, you cleaned up your subscription by removing the **resource groups** used in this lab.
