# Lab: Deploying compute workloads by using images and containers
# Student lab manual

## Lab scenario

Your organization is seeking a way to automatically create virtual machines (VMs) to run tasks and immediately terminate. You are tasked with evaluating multiple compute services in Microsoft Azure and determining which service can help you automatically create virtualized machines and install custom software on those machines. As a proof of concept, you have decided to try to create VMs from VHD images and container images so that you can compare the two solutions. To keep your proof of concept simple, you will create a special “IP check” application, written in .NET Core, that you will automatically deploy to your machines. Your proof of concept will evaluate the Azure Container Instances and Azure Virtual Machines services.

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

-   Create a VM manually or by using tools in the Azure portal.

-   Deploy a Docker container image to Azure Container Registry.

-   Deploy a container from a container image in Azure Container Registry by using Azure Container Instances.

-   Deploy a VM using an Azure Resource Manager template and a container image in Azure Container Registry.

## Lab Setup

-   **Estimated Time**: 75 minutes

## Instructions

### Before you start

#### Sign in to the lab virtual machine

Ensure that you are signed in to your **Windows 10** virtual machine using the following credentials:

- **Username**: Admin

- **Password**: Pa55w.rd

#### Review installed applications

Observe the taskbar located at the bottom of your **Windows 10** desktop. The taskbar contains the icons for the applications you will use in this lab:

-   Microsoft Edge

-   File Explorer

### Exercise 1: Create a virtual machine using the Azure portal

#### Task 1: Open the Azure portal

1.  Sign in to the **Azure portal** (<https://portal.azure.com>).

1.  If this is your first time signing in to the Azure portal, a dialog box will appear and a tour of the portal will start. Select the **Get Started** button to skip the tour.

#### Task 2: Create a resource group

1.  Create a new **resource group** with the following details:

    1.  **Name**: ContainerCompute

    1.  **Location**: (US) East US

1.  Wait for the creation task to complete before moving forward with this lab.

#### Task 3: Create a Linux virtual machine resource

1.  Create a new **Virtual Machine** with the following details:

      - **Operating system**: Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS

      - **Name**: simplevm

      - **Disk type**: SSD

      - **Username**: Student

      - **Password**: StudentPa55w.rd

      - **Resource group**: ContainerCompute

      - **Location**: (US) East US

      - **Size**: Standard B1s

      - **Public inbound ports**: SSH (22)

1.  Wait for the creation task to complete before moving on with this lab.

#### Task 4: Validate the virtual machine

1.  Access the **simplevm** VM that you created earlier in this lab.

1.  Open the **Connect to virtual machine** pop-up.

1.  Copy the **SSH command** to connect to the VM by using port **22** and the **Public IP address**. You will use this command later in this lab.

1.  Open a new **Cloud Shell** instance in the Azure Portal.

1.  If the **Cloud Shell** is not already configured, configure the shell for Bash by using the default settings.

1.  Within the **Cloud Shell** command prompt, use the **SSH command** that you copied earlier in this lab to connect to the VM by using SSH.

1.  During the connection process, you will receive a warning that the authenticity of the host cannot be verified. Continue connecting to the host. Finally, use the password **StudentPa55w.rd** when prompted for credentials

1.  When you are connected to the VM, use the following commands to view information about the machine:

    ```bash
    uname -mnipo
    ```
    ```bash
    uname -srv
    ```

1.  Close the **Cloud Shell** pane.

#### Review

In this exercise, you created a new VM manually by using the Azure portal interface and connected to the VM by using the Cloud Shell and secure shell (SSH).

### Exercise 2: Create a virtual machine by using Azure CLI

#### Task 1: Open Cloud Shell

1.  Open a new **Cloud Shell** instance in the Azure Portal.

#### Task 2: Use the Azure CLI commands

1.  Use the **az** command with the **--help** flag to view a list of subgroups and commands at the root level of the CLI.

1.  Use the **az vm** command with the **--help** flag to view a list of subgroups and commands for **Virtual Machines**:

1.  Use the **az vm create** command with the **--help** flag to view a list of arguments and examples for the **Create Virtual Machine** command:

1.  Use the **az vm create** command to create a new **Virtual Machine** with the following settings:

      - **Resource group**: ContainerCompute

      - **Name**: quickvm

      - **Image**: Debian

      - **Username**: student

      - **Password**: StudentPa55w.rd

1.  Wait for the VM creation process to complete. After the process completes, the command will return a JSON file with details about the machine.

1.  Use the **az vm show** command to view a more detailed JSON file that contains various metadata about the newly created VM.

1.  Use the **az vm list-ip-addresses** command to list all the IP addresses associated with the VM:

    ```bash
    az vm list-ip-addresses --resource-group ContainerCompute --name quickvm
    ```

1.  Use the **az vm list-ip-addresses** command and the **--query** argument to filter the output to only return the first IP address value:

    ```bash
    az vm list-ip-addresses --resource-group ContainerCompute --name quickvm --query '[].{ip:virtualMachine.network.publicIpAddresses[0].ipAddress}' --output tsv
    ```

1.  Use the following script to store the results of the previous command in a new Bash shell variable named *ipAddress*:

    ```bash
    ipAddress=$(az vm list-ip-addresses --resource-group ContainerCompute --name quickvm --query '[].{ip:virtualMachine.network.publicIpAddresses[0].ipAddress}' --output tsv)
    ```

1. Use the following script to print the value of the Bash shell variable *ipAddress*:

    ```bash
    echo $ipAddress
    ```

1. Use the following script to connect to the VM that you created earlier in this lab by using the SSH tool and the IP address stored in the Bash shell variable *ipAddress*:

    ```bash
    ssh student@$ipAddress
    ```

1. During the connection process, you will receive a warning that the authenticity of the host cannot be verified. Continue connecting to the host. Finally, use the password **StudentPa55w.rd** when prompted for credentials

1. After you are connected to the VM, use the following commands to observe information about the machine to ensure that you are connected to the correct VM:

    ```bash
    uname -mnipo
    ```
    ```bash
    uname -srv
    ```
1. Close the **Cloud Shell** pane.

        {
            if (System.Net.NetworkInformation.NetworkInterface.GetIsNetworkAvailable())
            {
                System.Console.WriteLine("Current IP Addresses:");
                string hostname = System.Net.Dns.GetHostName();
                System.Net.IPHostEntry host = System.Net.Dns.GetHostEntry(hostname);
                foreach(System.Net.IPAddress address in host.AddressList)
                {
                    System.Console.WriteLine($"\t{address}");
                }
            }
            else
            {
                System.Console.WriteLine("No Network Connection");
            }
        }
    }
    ```

1.  Use the **dotnet run** command in the command prompt to execute the application and validate that it finds one or more IP addresses.

1.  Open the **Dockerfile** file in the graphical editor, replace its contents with the following code, and then **Save** the file:

    ```dockerfile
    FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:2.2-alpine AS build
    WORKDIR /app

    COPY *.csproj ./
    RUN dotnet restore

#### Task 4: Open Cloud Shell and store Azure Container Registry metadata

1.  Open a new **Cloud Shell** instance.

1.  Within the **Cloud Shell** command prompt, use the **az acr list** command to view a list of all **container registries** in your subscription.

1.  Use the following command to output the name of the most recently created **container registry**:

    ```bash
    az acr list --query "max_by([], &creationDate).name" --output tsv
    ```

1.  Use the following command to save the name of the most recently created **container registry** in a Bash shell variable *acrName*:

    ```bash
    acrName=$(az acr list --query "max_by([], &creationDate).name" --output tsv)
    ```

1.  Use the following script to print the value of the Bash shell variable *acrName*:

    ```bash
    echo $acrName
    ```

#### Task 5: Deploy a Docker container image to Azure Container Registry

1.  Change the active directory to **\~/clouddrive/ipcheck**.

1.  Use the **dir** command to view the contents of the current directory.

    > **Note**: You will know that you are in the correct directory if both the **Program.cs** and **Dockerfile** files that you edited earlier in this lab are there.

1.  Use the following command to upload the source code to your **container registry** and build the container image as an **Azure Container Registry Task**:

    ```bash
    az acr build --registry $acrName --image ipcheck:latest .
    ```

1.  Wait for the build task to complete before moving forward with this lab.
