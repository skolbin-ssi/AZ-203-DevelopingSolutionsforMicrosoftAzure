# Lab: Access resource secrets securely across services
# Student lab answer key

## Microsoft Azure user interface

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you might experience Azure user interface (UI) changes after the development of this training content. These changes might cause the lab instructions and lab steps to not match up.

Microsoft updates this training course as soon as the community brings needed changes to our attention. However, because cloud updates occur frequently, you might encounter UI changes before this training content is updated. **If this occurs, adapt to the changes and work through them in the labs as needed.**

## Instructions

### Before you start

#### Sign in to the lab virtual machine

Sign in to your **Windows 10** virtual machine by using the following credentials:

-   **Username**: Admin

    using System.Net;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Primitives;
    using Newtonsoft.Json;

    public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(HttpRequest req, ILogger log)
    {

        log.LogInformation("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");

        string name = req.Query["name"];

        string requestBody = await new StreamReader(req.Body).ReadToEndAsync();

        dynamic data = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(requestBody);

        name = name ?? data?.name;

        return name != null
            ? (ActionResult)new OkObjectResult($"Hello, {name}")
            : new BadRequestObjectResult("Please pass a name on the query string or in the request body");
    }
    ```

1.  **Delete** all the example code.

1.  Within the function editor, copy and paste the following placeholder function:

    ```cs
    using System.Net;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

    public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(HttpRequest req)
    {
        return new OkObjectResult("Test Successful");
    }
    ```

1.  Select **Save and run** to save the script and perform a test execution of the function.

1. The **Test** and **Logs** panes will automatically appear when the script executes for the first time.

1. Observe the **Output** text box in the **Test** pane. You should now see the value **Test Successful** returned from the function.

#### Task 3: Test the Key Vault-derived application setting

1.  Delete the existing code within the **Run** method of the script.

1.  The **Run** method should now look like this:

    ```cs

    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

    public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(HttpRequest req)
    {

    }
    ```

    ```cs
    using System.Net;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

    public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(HttpRequest req)
    {
        string connectionString = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("StorageConnectionString");
        return new OkObjectResult(connectionString);
    }
    ```

1.  Select **Save and run** to save the script and perform a test execution of the function.

1.  Observe the **Output** text box in the **Test** pane. You should now see the connection string returned from the function.

#### Review

In this exercise, you securely used a service identity to read the value of a secret stored in **Azure Key Vault** and return that value as the result of an **Azure Function**.

    {
        string connectionString = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("StorageConnectionString");
        BlobServiceClient serviceClient = new BlobServiceClient(connectionString);
        BlobContainerClient containerClient = serviceClient.GetBlobContainerClient("drop");
        BlobClient blobClient = containerClient.GetBlobClient("records.json");
        var response = await blobClient.DownloadAsync();
        return new FileStreamResult(response?.Value?.Content, response?.Value?.ContentType);
    }
    ```

1.  Select **Save and run** to save the script and perform a test execution of the function.

1.  Observe the **Output** text box in the **Test** pane. You should now see the content of the **$/drop/records.json** blob stored in your **storage account**.

#### Review

In this exercise, you used C\# code to access a Storage Account securely and then download the contents of a blob.

### Exercise 5: Clean up subscription

#### Task 1: Open Azure Cloud Shell and list resource groups

1.  In the top navigation bar in the Azure Portal, select the **Cloud Shell** icon to open a new shell instance.

    > **Note**: The **Cloud Shell** icon is represented by a greater than symbol and underscore character.

1.  If this is your first time opening the **Cloud Shell** by using your subscription, a **Welcome to Azure Cloud Shell Wizard** will appear that allows you to configure **Cloud Shell** for first-time usage. Perform the following actions in the wizard:

    1.  A dialog box will appear that prompts you to create a new Storage Account to begin using the shell. Accept the default settings and select **Create storage**.

    1.  Wait for the **Cloud Shell** to finish its first-time setup procedures before moving forward with the lab.

    > **Note**: If you do not see the configuration options for the **Cloud Shell**, this is most likely because you are using an existing subscription with this course's labs. The labs are written from the presumption that you are using a new subscription.

1.  In the **Cloud Shell** command prompt at the bottom of the portal, type in the following command and press Enter to list all resource groups in the subscription:

    ```powershell
    az group list
    ```

1.  In the prompt, type the following command and press Enter to view a list of possible commands to delete a resource group:

    ```powershell
    az group delete --help
    ```

#### Task 2: Delete resource group

1.  In the prompt, type the following command and press Enter to delete the **SecureFunction** resource group:

    ```powershell
    az group delete --name SecureFunction --no-wait --yes
    ```

1.  Close the **Cloud Shell** pane at the bottom of the portal.

#### Task 3: Close active application

> Close the currently running **Microsoft Edge** application.

#### Review

In this exercise, you cleaned up your subscription by removing the **resource groups** used in this lab.
