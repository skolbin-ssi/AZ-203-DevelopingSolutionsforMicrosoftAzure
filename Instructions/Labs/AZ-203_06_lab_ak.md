# Lab: Creating a multi-tier solution by using services in Azure
# Student lab answer key

## Microsoft Azure user interface

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you might experience Azure user interface (UI) changes after the development of this training content. These changes might cause the lab instructions and steps to not match up.

The Microsoft Worldwide Learning team updates this training course as soon as the community brings needed changes to our attention. However, because cloud updates occur frequently, you might encounter UI changes before this training content is updated. **If this occurs, adapt to the changes and work through them in the labs as needed.**

    1.  In the new **Value** field, select the list, select the **+ Add Value** link, and then enter **Contoso**.

    1.  In the new **Action** list, select **override**.

    1. Select **Save**.

1. Back in the **Design** tab, in the list of operations, select **List All Documents**.

1. Select the **Test** tab.

1. Select the **List All Documents** operation.

1. In the **List All Documents** section, select **Send**.

1. Observe the results of the API request.

    > **Note**: You will observe that the **preference-applied** and **odata-version** headers that you specified have been deleted and replaced with a new **powered-by** header. You will also notice that the response doesn’t contain context data about the OData response, but instead contains a flattened JSON array as the response body.

#### Review

In this exercise, you built a proxy tier between your Azure Cognitive Search account and any developers who wish to make search queries.

### Exercise 4: Create new table entities by using Azure Logic Apps

#### Task 1: Create a Logic Apps resource

        "name": ""
    }
    ```

1.  Select **Done**.

1.  Observe the schema in the **Request Body JSON Schema** field. This schema is built by Azure automatically based on the JSON content that you entered in the previous step.

#### Task 3: Build a connector for Azure Storage

#### Task 5: Retrieve a HTTP trigger POST URL

1.  In the **Designer** area, select **Save**.

1.  After the workflow is saved, the **HTTP POST URL** field in the **When a HTTP request is received** trigger will be updated with a new URL that you’ll need to start this workflow. Copy the URL in the **HTTP POST URL** field. You will use this URL later in this lab.

    > **Note**: This is a very long URL because it includes the URL with the SAS token. Make sure that you copy the entire URL.

#### Task 6: Validate that logic app results are indexed

1.  At the top of the portal, select the **Cloud Shell** icon to open a new shell instance.

    > **Note**: The **Cloud Shell** icon is represented by a greater than symbol and underscore character.

1.  If this is your first time opening the **Cloud Shell** by using your subscription, a **Welcome to Azure Cloud Shell** wizard will display how to configure **Cloud Shell** for first-time usage. Perform the following actions:

    1.  When offered a choice between **Bash** or **PowerShell**, select **Bash**.

    1.  A dialog box prompts you to create a new Storage account to begin by using the shell. Accept the default settings and select **Create storage**.

    1.  Wait for the **Cloud Shell** to finish its first-time setup procedures before you move forward with the lab.

        > **Note**: If you the configuration options for the **Cloud Shell** do not appear, this is most likely because you are using an existing subscription with this course's labs. The labs are written from the perspective that you are using a new subscription.

1.  At the bottom of the portal, in the **Cloud Shell** command prompt, enter the following partial **CURL** command to issue a **HTTP POST** request to the Logic Apps instance and then press **Enter**:

    ```bash
    curl \
    --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{"id":"6","manufacturer":"VEHTOP","price":750,"quantity":6,"name":"car roof rack"}' \
    ```

1.  Next, enter the logic app’s **HTTP POST URL** that you copied earlier in this lab, ensuring that you place the URL within **quotation marks** so that the URL characters are not escaped. Press **Enter** to execute the command.

    > **Note**: For example, if the URL is https://prod.eastus.logic.azure.com:443/workflows/test/triggers/invoke?api-version=2016\&sig=3, then you would insert “https://prod.eastus.logic.azure.com:443/workflows/test/triggers/manual?invoke?api-version=2016\&sig=3”. If you don’t include the quotation marks, you will get an error message indicating that the SAS token has been truncated and is required to issue the request. This occurs because the query string separator, **&,** is truncated if not enclosed in quotation marks.

1.  In the left navigation pane of the portal, select **Resource groups**.

1.  In the **Resource groups** blade, select the **MultiTierService** resource group that you created earlier in this lab.

1.  In the **MultiTierService** blade, select the **prodsearch\*** Search service that you created earlier in this lab.

1.  In the **Search Service** blade, select the **Indexers** tab.

1.  In the **Indexers** tab, select the **tableindexer** indexer that you created earlier in this lab.

1. In the **Indexer** blade, perform the following actions:

    1. Select **Run**.

    1. When prompted for confirmation, select **Yes**.

    1. Close the **Indexer** blade.

1. Wait for the indexer to finish running, and then select **Refresh** at the top of the blade.

1. Back in the **Search Service** blade, select **Search Explorer**.

1. In the **Search Explorer** blade, select **Search**.

1. Observe the results of a search for all documents.

    > **Note**: At this point, you will notice a sixth document in your index representing the new document that was inserted by the logic app.

1. In the left navigation pane of the portal, select **Resource groups**.

1. In the **Resource groups** blade, select the **MultiTierService** resource group that you created earlier in this lab.

1. In the **MultiTierService** blade, select the **prodapi\*** API Management account that you created earlier in this lab.

1. In the **API Management Service** blade, on the left side of the blade, in the **API Management** section, select **APIs** .

1. In the **APIs** section, select **Search API**.

1. In the **Design** tab, select the **Test** tab.

1. Select the **List All Documents** operation.

1. In the **List All Documents** section, select **Send**.

1. Observe the results of the API request.

    > **Note**: Observe that there are six documents now instead of five.

#### Review

In this exercise, you created a logic app that takes a HTTP request and then persists the JSON body of the request as a new Azure Storage table entity.

### Exercise 5: Clean up subscription

#### Task 1: Open Cloud Shell

1.  At the top of the portal, select the **Cloud Shell** icon to open a new shell instance.

1.  At the bottom of the portal, in the **Cloud Shell** command prompt, type the following command and press Enter to list all resource groups in the subscription:

    ```bash
    az group list
    ```

1.  Type the following command and press Enter to view a list of possible commands to delete a resource group:

    ```bash
    az group delete --help
    ```

#### Task 2: Delete resource groups

1.  Type the following command and press Enter to delete the **MultiTierService** resource group:

    ```bash
    az group delete --name MultiTierService --no-wait --yes
    ```

1.  Close the **Cloud Shell** pane at the bottom of the portal.

#### Task 3: Close active applications

1.  Close the currently running **Microsoft Edge** application.

1.  Close the currently running **Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer** application.

#### Review

In this exercise, you cleaned up your subscription by removing the **resource groups** used in this lab.
